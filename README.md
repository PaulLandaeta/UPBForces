<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Algoforces is an online judge platform where one can make an account and submit solutions to different predefined problems, similiar to that of Hackerrank, CSES, Codeforces etc.
The user interface is built with ReactJS, and the backend is built with NodeJS/ExpressJS, along with MongoDB as database.

* [jDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/compiler-api/)
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can run the judge on your local system by forking the repo, downloading the source code, install the npm packages, getting your api keys and setting up as described in the '.env.example' and making a '.env' file.
